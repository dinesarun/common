4.0,,FALSE,"10 20, 2010",A38NELQT98S4H8, DVD-ROM,WB Halper,"I've been using Dreamweaver (and it's predecessor Macromedia's UltraDev) for many years.  For someone who is an experienced web designer, this course is a high-level review of the CS5 version of Dreamweaver, but it doesn't go into a great enough level of detail to find it very useful.\n\nOn the other hand, this is a great tool for someone who is a relative novice at web design.  It starts off with a basic overview of HTML and continues through the concepts necessary to build a modern web site.  Someone who goes through this course should exit with enough knowledge to create something that does what you want it do do...within reason.  Don't expect to go off and build an entire e-commerce system with only this class under your belt.\n\nIt's important to note that there's a long gap from site design to actual implementation.  This course teaches you how to implement a design.  The user interface and overall user experience is a different subject that isn't covered here...it's possible to do a great implementation of an absolutely abysmal design.  I speak from experience.  :)\n\nAs I said above, if you're a novice, a relative newcomer or just an experienced web designer who wants a refresher course, this is a good way to do it.",A solid overview of Dreamweaver CS5
5.0,3,FALSE,"10 16, 2010",ACJT8MUC0LRF0, DVD-ROM,D. Fowler,"If you've been wanting to learn how to create your own website, but have either lacked the confidence or knowledge, this affordable combination book and video course will enable you to learn at your own leisure.  There are more than twelve hours of video training included in this package, most of it split up in the small, absorbable sections.  This courseware is ""Certified Associate,"" approved courseware.  Dreamweaver is the premier product for website creation.  It offers several new advantages/features for the user.  It has improved dynamic applications, new CSS features that offer more control over your design, you can turn individual CSS properties on and off (you can see how they affect your designs), and you can fuse box model elements to troubleshoot directly within Dreamweaver.  If you are confident this DVD/book bundle is for you, you can simply bypass this review or read some shorter versions (this is a very long review).  If not, keep on reading.\n\nWith this software you'll learn a lot of basics, however, if you are already a web designer or have a lot of experience, you may find a lot of the material to be redundant.  On the other hand, if you are anxious to learn web design, this is the perfect place to start.  Taking a course can cost you a lot of $, but this course is quite affordable ... if you decide it is not for you, then you can hand it along to someone else.  You'll be getting more than twelve hours of video training from ""Adobe Certified Instructors"", a reference book, lesson files, and you can copy certain files to your iPhone, iPod, or iPad.\n\nFor the hearing impaired the script to the dialogue runs along the bottom as the narrator speaks. You can stop the video at any time to get a closer look at what is being done and/or absorb the material.  At the end of each section is a ""test"" to enable you to know just how you are progressing on each section.\n\nIf you are in a bookstore you can easily pick up a copy and glance at the book, but you cannot see what is on the DVD.  I'll try to describe what is on the DVD to the buyer can get a good understanding of what is on there and can decide if Adobe Dreamweaver CS5 is what they need.

3.0,16,FALSE,"01 9, 2011",A1E50L7PCVXLN4, DVD-ROM,Colinda,"There are over 100 video lessons here. Most users have given this a high rating and I assume they are very comfortable with video learning. Personally I found it rather tedious.\n\nI'd like to learn Lightroom because I've owned it for a while. I tried to use it but did not understand it so I went back to using Adobe Bridge, which is think is generally under-appreciated. I love Photoshop but tend to spend a lot of time with it, so the supposed time-saving features of Lightroom would be helpful.\n\nI really hoped this product would make it easy for me to use Lightroom. Unfortunately I had trouble staying alert through more than 3 or 4 lessons at a time, and that much only covers a small portion of the material.  I don't think this is because of the presenters so much as it is the difficulty of covering this sort of material in a video format.\n\nThe Introduction alone consists of 26 videos. It seemed like a commercial for Lightroom rather than a tutorial. Seven of the lessons are devoted to ""What's New"" -- not too relevant for beginners. On the plus side, there were plenty of screen shots to familiarize us with the look of the software.\n\nUnit 2 has 11 video lessons on importing pictures. That gives you an idea on how much detail is here. If that's what you need, you'll find this product useful.",For Highly Motivated and Patient People

2.0,,FALSE,"01 8, 2011",A1T2ZO4ARVSUGE, Box,Dave Greenbaum,"This Windows ""program"" is a hodge-podge amalgamation of a variety of eBooks, PDFs, and help guides without integration and coordination.  Confusion was the only consistent theme in this application.  Put out by Quicken, the documents are actually created by Nolo, which is a trusted source of legal information.  I'd suggest buying their books instead.\n\nThe program includes sections on: Buying or Selling a Business; Contracts for Goods and Services; Corporate Minutes and Consents; Forming a Business; Hiring Workers; Leasing Space; LLC Minutes and Consents; Managing Finances; Buying and Selling Real Estate; and Tax Forms.\n\nIn these sections, instead of giving you a handy Microsoft Word Document that you can fill in obvious blanks on, the program makes you go through a step by step interview and often doesn't remember the information you enter from one form to another so you must enter your name, the name of the business and so forth all over again.  Nor does it integrate with any contact managers so you can easily fill in from there.  When your interview is complete, the document saves only in text or RTF format, which are highly compatible with most programs but at this point, .doc is pretty standard.\n\nMany of the items in these sections are simply Adobe Acrobat forms without the ability to edit or annotate them unless you have something besides Acrobat reader.\n\nIncluded in the program are ""checklists""  that are very short guides on very weighty subjects such as ""How to Form an LLC"" and ""How to Set Up Tax Reporting and Accounting"".  All these checklists do though is point you to other Nolo books or websites and are unable to offer any advice in and of themselves.  In other words, pretty much worthless.\n\nMost frustrating to me was the business library which were simple PDFs (or Windows antiquated ""Book Reader"" format of:  Starting & Running a Small Business; Tax Savvy for Small Business; The Manager's Legal Handbook; How to Write a Business Plan; and Business Loans From Family and Friends.  Unfortunately, these books were previous versions and the newest versions of these books (despite the 2011 in the title of the program) are available elsewhere.\n\nAdditionally, also included with the program is a printed book called ""Your Little Legal Companion"" that has absolutely nothing to do with business and contains basic personal legal information that borders on the silly such as ""Moving in with your Lover"" and ""Getting Old."" These tidbits of advice had little substantive or legal value and were more like a sidebar from a Sunday newspaper magazine than anything that could be used for real reference or planning.\n\nUpon registering the book, Nolo will send you a PDF of their book ""101 Law Forms for Personal Use"".  Again, this is just a PDF and not any templates that can actually be used within a program.\n\nCombined together the program is a good value for all that you are getting.  However if you don't really need all that or want the current versions, I recommend purchasing this collection of eBooks and PDFs individually.",A bunch of outdated eBooks in a confusing arrangement
